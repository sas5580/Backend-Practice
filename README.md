Tasks:
* Set up a RESTful API using Python3, Docker, Docker-machine, Flask-Restful and MongoDB.
* Implement the following HTTP methods within this RESTful API [GET, PUT, POST, DELETE]
* The API structure will include a default app.py file which will act as the controller and handle all API requests.
* The API structure will also include a model class which will act as the object initializer and handle all business logic.
* The API structure will also include a DAO class which will handle all communication between the model and the database.
